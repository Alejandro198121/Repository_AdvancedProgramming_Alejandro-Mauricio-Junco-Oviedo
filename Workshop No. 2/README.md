# Workshop 2

This workshopis focused on build a backend system with a catalog of vehicles ti be sell in a car company.

for thi case, some requirements are defined as follows:

Each vehicle has at least engine, chasis (A or B), model, gas consumption, and year.
Depending on the vehicle type, you should define additional properties.
• There are different vehicle types (for now): car, truck, yacht, and motorcycle.
• Each engine has at least a name, type of engine, potency, and weight.
• To calculate the vehicle gas consumption you could create a method based on:
1.1 ∗ engine.potency + 0.2 ∗ engine.weight - (0.3 if A or 0.5 if B)
